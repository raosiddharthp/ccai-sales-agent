<h1>Selling with Omni CCAI – Smart Configurator Sales Agent</h1>

<h2>1. Description</h2>
<p>A GCP-native Dialogflow CX virtual agent designed to perform guided, attribute-based product configuration while actively driving revenue through intelligent upselling and cross-selling. The agent simulates a high-end medical imaging device suite (MRI, CT, Ultrasound, X-Ray), enforcing real-world configuration rules (dependencies, compatibility, validation), calculating dynamic pricing, and proactively recommending complementary products and upgrades. All logic is self-contained within GCP services, demonstrating how Contact Center AI (CCAI) can evolve from cost-center support to revenue-generating sales conversations.</p>

<!-- Paste the rest of the 10-point design document here, exactly as before, but in pure HTML paragraphs/lists -->

<h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The Smart Configurator Sales Agent showcases the application of Dialogflow CX and Vertex AI generative capabilities to one of the most complex and valuable enterprise sales use cases: attribute-based configuration combined with guided selling. By replicating key CPQ behaviors (rule enforcement, dynamic pricing, bundle validation) in a conversational interface without requiring Salesforce or third-party CPQ systems, the prototype illustrates a lightweight, modern alternative for guided selling in omnichannel environments. The design emphasizes simplicity of deployment, transparency of logic, and extensibility toward production integration.</p>
